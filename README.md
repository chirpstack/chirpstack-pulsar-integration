# ChirpStack Pulsar integration

ChirpStack Pulsar integration publishes [ChirpStack integration events](https://www.chirpstack.io/docs/chirpstack/integrations/events.html)
to an [Apache Pulsar](https://pulsar.apache.org/) instance. It reads
integration events by directly subscribing to the Redis event [stream](https://redis.io/docs/data-types/streams/).
